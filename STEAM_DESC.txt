[h2]Mod Information[/h2]

This mod adds two major class of mutators: Agent Randomizer and Skin Randomizer. The Agent Randomizer will randomize the agent spawned during a run, which will affect their negotiation/combat behaviours, their boons/banes, etc. The Skin Randomizer will randomize the appearance of an agent when they spawn. With tons of customizations on the randomization process, this mod will break all rules of the existing game.

Additional mutators extends from the base class, and usually have various minor change in the settings.

[h2]Changelog[/h2]

[h3]0.2.0[/h3]

* Add an additional option: Use new character animation. You can now select whether you want to use the original character's animations or use the disguised ones. If you want to see Rook holding a shotgun, or Fssh with rocket legs, now you can!
* Added localizations for Chinese Simplified and Chinese Traditional. This even works with modded languages, as long as the modded language has zh_HANT or zh_HANS defined as one of the default languages.
* This mod loads after 简中文本优化/Better CHS L10N (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2234153945) so that I can add localization files to this modded language. I have to convince Klei to implement the mod load order code I wrote into the base game in order for this to work, but it's totally worth it.

[h3]0.1.1[/h3]

* Now replaced agent always keep their original faction, because otherwise Rook's story will softlock because your handler's faction is neither Rise or Spark Baron. The old "Retain Faction" setting is UI only now.
* Some other minor optimizations.

[h3]0.1.0[/h3]

* Mod released!
